PHISHES seeks to bridge the gap between soil health data and actions, providing much-needed predictive capability in terms of the consequences of actions on the provision of soil functions and associated ecosystem services, taking into account soil use, soil contamination and various drivers such as climate change.

### Python tools for retrieving model input data
The repository contains jupyter notebooks with tools for downloading forcing data for the models that are relevant for the PHISHES simulation platform. The forcing data will be cropped to the model domain and can be converted to standard formats - like netcdf, Zarr or dfs2.

## Requirements
* Windows or Linux operating system
* Python x64 3.10 - 3.13
